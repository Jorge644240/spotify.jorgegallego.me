## Overview

### The Application

This application allows the users to search the Spotify music database for artists and songs through the web.
Users can choose which search criteria to use, and can also use them together.
An artist search will return only one result, as well as a artist AND song search.
A song search will return the top five results.

In the case that the intended result doesn't appear, the user can be redirected to Google Search if they want to, through a link at the end if the results page.
